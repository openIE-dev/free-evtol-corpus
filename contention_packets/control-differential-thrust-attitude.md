## How to use this packet

This document is an invalidity-contention packet — a chronologically-ordered
list of every disclosed prior art reference in the Free eVTOL Corpus that
bears on the subsystem `control-differential-thrust-attitude`.

To use it:

1. Identify the patent claim element being challenged.
2. Match the element against the entries below in chronological order (earliest
   first). The earliest entry that discloses the element is the strongest 102
   anticipation candidate.
3. For 103 obviousness contentions, identify the closest two-or-more entries
   that together disclose all claim elements.
4. Each entry's **prior_art_notes** field is element-by-element 102/103
   anticipation analysis — citable as-is.
5. Verify the timestamp authority via the procedures in the corpus repo's
   release artifacts (FreeTSA RFC 3161, DigiCert RFC 3161, OpenTimestamps
   Bitcoin-anchored).

The Free eVTOL Corpus is licensed CC0 1.0; no permission is required to

## Entries (chronological)

### 1922 — Pescara helicopter

- **id:** `pescara-helicopter`
- **corpus:** academic
- **ip status:** patented
- **creator:** Raúl Pateras Pescara de Castelluccio
- **disclosure citation:** Pescara helicopter No.3 (later 3F) developed at Issy-les-Moulineaux, France; set FAI distance world record 736 m on 1924-04-18 with Pescara at controls. Pescara holds Spanish patent ES86,124 (1920) and French patents covering biplane coaxial counter-rotating rotor design with cyclic and collective pitch control.
- **disclosed subsystems:** `cert-experimental`, `control-differential-thrust-attitude`, `lift-coaxial-rotor`

**Prior art notes:**

> Pescara is the foundational Argentine/Spanish disclosure of practical coaxial counter-rotating rotor lift with cyclic+collective pitch control. Contemporaneous with de Bothezat's quadrotor (1922) but in coaxial geometry rather than X-frame. Establishes prior art for: (1) coaxial counter-rotating rotor architecture for torque cancellation without tail rotor (foundational to modern Kamov Ka-line and to coaxial-pair lift modules in eVTOL such as Beta Alia, Wisk Cora, EHang EH216), (2) the cyclic + collective pitch control invention. Combined with verne-albatross (1886) and de-bothezat-quadrotor (1922), provides multi-architecture 1880–1922 prior art base. The Pescara patents (ES86,124 et seq.) have been expired for over 80 years.

### 1922-12-18 — de Bothezat helicopter

- **id:** `de-bothezat-quadrotor`
- **corpus:** academic
- **ip status:** public-domain
- **creator:** George de Bothezat / U.S. Army Air Service (McCook Field)
- **disclosure citation:** U.S. Army Air Service report on first manned flight of the de Bothezat helicopter at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, 1922-12-18; documented in NACA technical literature and McCook Field records.
- **disclosed subsystems:** `cert-experimental`, `control-differential-thrust-attitude`, `lift-distributed-electric-propulsion`

**Prior art notes:**

> First manned multirotor heavier-than-air vehicle to achieve sustained hover (approximately 100 flights between 1922 and 1924). Establishes prior art for: (1) X-frame quadrotor airframe geometry, (2) differential-thrust attitude control between independently-controlled lift rotors, (3) multi-rotor mechanical lift platform. The 1922 disclosure is referenced in nearly every modern academic survey of multirotor history and is foundational to invalidity arguments against any post-1922 quadrotor airframe-geometry or attitude-allocation claims. Although the propulsion is mechanical rather than electric, the architectural decomposition (lift via plural independent rotors, attitude via differential thrust) is identical to modern electric multirotor designs. Combined with verne-albatross (1886), this entry blocks any patent attempt to claim the basic multirotor architectural pattern as novel.

### 1958 — Curtiss-Wright VZ-7

- **id:** `curtiss-wright-vz-7`
- **corpus:** academic
- **ip status:** public-domain
- **creator:** Curtiss-Wright / U.S. Army Transportation Research Command
- **disclosure citation:** U.S. Army Transportation Research Command 'Flying Jeep' program; VZ-7 first flight 1958. Documented in TRC test reports and Markman & Holder, Straight Up (Schiffer 2000).
- **disclosed subsystems:** `cert-military`, `control-differential-thrust-attitude`, `lift-distributed-electric-propulsion`

**Prior art notes:**

> The VZ-7 is one of three contemporaneous U.S. Army 'flying jeep' programs (with the Chrysler VZ-6 and Piasecki VZ-8) that disclosed the modern open-rotor quadrotor architecture in 1958, controlled by differential rotor thrust at the four corners of an X-frame. Establishes a 1958 anchor for: (1) corner-mounted open-rotor quad configuration, (2) cross-shafted single-engine drive of four lift rotors (mechanical analogue of modern electric quadrotors with DC-link power sharing), (3) differential-thrust attitude allocation. Combined with de-bothezat-quadrotor (1922), this places the basic open-rotor quadrotor lift architecture in the public domain a full half-century before any modern multirotor patent attempt. The Hoversurf S3 and Aerofex hover bike as well as Jetson ONE all sit downstream of this disclosure.

- **disclosed subsystems:** `cert-military`, `control-differential-thrust-attitude`, `lift-distributed-electric-propulsion`

**Prior art notes:**

> Piasecki VZ-8 Airgeep is the third major U.S. Army 'flying jeep' program of 1958 (with Curtiss-Wright VZ-7 and Chrysler VZ-6), establishing prior art for: (1) tandem fore-and-aft open-rotor architecture (precursor to Aerofex Aero-X hover-bike geometry by 50 years), (2) cross-coupled twin-piston-engine drive with engine-out continued lift. The hover-bike architecture descends directly from this 1958 disclosure.
