## How to use this packet

This document is an invalidity-contention packet — a chronologically-ordered
list of every disclosed prior art reference in the Free eVTOL Corpus that
bears on the subsystem `control-rotor-failure-reconfiguration`.

To use it:

1. Identify the patent claim element being challenged.
2. Match the element against the entries below in chronological order (earliest
   first). The earliest entry that discloses the element is the strongest 102
   anticipation candidate.
3. For 103 obviousness contentions, identify the closest two-or-more entries
   that together disclose all claim elements.
4. Each entry's **prior_art_notes** field is element-by-element 102/103
   anticipation analysis — citable as-is.
5. Verify the timestamp authority via the procedures in the corpus repo's
   release artifacts (FreeTSA RFC 3161, DigiCert RFC 3161, OpenTimestamps
   Bitcoin-anchored).

The Free eVTOL Corpus is licensed CC0 1.0; no permission is required to
cite, copy, or redistribute these contentions.

- **disclosure citation:** Aurora Flight Sciences LightningStrike XV-24A awarded DARPA VTOL X-Plane Phase 3 contract 2016-03-03; sub-scale demonstrator first hover 2017-04. Program subsequently de-scoped without full-scale first flight, but Aurora's design and test data were extensively published in DARPA reports and AIAA papers.

**Prior art notes:**

> ModQuad establishes the foundational disclosure of *mid-air-docking* modular multirotor architecture — quadrotors that fly individually, align in flight, dock together, and operate as a single composite airframe. Establishes prior art for: (1) mid-air physical docking of quadrotor modules into a single rigid airframe, (2) magnetic edge-connector docking architecture for in-flight assembly, (3) distributed control allocation across N modules of a composite multirotor with N scaling up or down at runtime, (4) the cuboid-frame protective geometry enabling collision-tolerant docking maneuvers. Combined with eth-distributed-flight-array (2010 precursor), comprehensively places modular-docking eVTOL architecture in academic public-domain prior art. **Critical for any future commercial eVTOL patent claim asserting novelty over modular reconfigurable multirotor or swarm-to-single-airframe transitions** — a likely future commercial direction for scalable cargo/passenger eVTOL.
